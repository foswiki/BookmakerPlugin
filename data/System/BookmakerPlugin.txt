%TOC%

The Bookmaker plugin provides support for interactive capture and sorting of ordered lists of topics.

<br class="foswikiClear">

The lists are held in topics, and may be manually edited, or can be manipulated through the interface.

<img src="%ATTACHURL%/expanded.png"/>

This plugin also provides an API for access to the lists, as a service to other extensions such as the
!PublishPlugin and !TocPlugin.

The interactive features of this plugin require the !JQueryPlugin, and requires Javascript to be enabled in
the user's browser. The API can still be used without the interactive features enabled, however.

---++ Usage
%IF{"context 'BookmakerPluginEnabled'"
 then="$percntBUTTON{\"click here\" class=\"bookmaker_button\" href=\"%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?open_bookmaker=Sandbox.ExampleBook\"}$percnt"
 else="Enable the plugin, and revisit this page"}%
 to enable the bookmaker interface, capturing a book in Sandbox.ExampleBook.

Once you have opened the bookmaker interface it will remain open until you close it again.
The bookmaker interface comprises a horizontal bar across the top of the page that carries buttons which support selecting your book, and adding and removing topics. More complex interactions are enabled when you expand the bar to show the full interface. This then allows you to interactively sort the topic list, and modify the indentation level of entries.

You can copy-paste the following macro into your own topics to create a button that starts
Bookmaker (change =Sandbox.ExampleBook= to the topic name of your choice):
<verbatim>
%BUTTON{"Start Bookmaker" class="bookmaker_button" href="%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?open_bookmaker=Sandbox.ExampleBook"}%
</verbatim>

---+++ Format of a book topic
At their simplest, book topics contain a list of topics, which can optionally be indented. Topics can be specified using a
variety of formats, best illustrated by an example:
<verbatim>
   * Mybooks.ChapterOne
   * ChapterTwo
      1 [[Chapter2.SectionOne]]
   * [[Chapter three][Chapter 3]]
      * [[Chapter3.sad story][Sad Story]]
</verbatim>
If topic names do not include a web specification, then the topics are assumed to be in the same web as the book topic.

A book topic may contain macros, but as soon as it is edited via the Bookmaker interface (e.g. by adding
or removing a topic) those macros will be expanded, and the topic will be saved as a simple list of topic
names.

Book topics may optionally represent hierarchy, through the use of indentation levels in the list.

An API is provided to allow other extensions to access the book. Note that the API should *always* be used
to access book topics, as their format may change radically in the future. When the plugin is installed, the
API will be documented [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PerlDoc?module=Foswiki::Plugins::BookmakerPlugin::Book][here]].

---+++ Macros

| *Macro* | *Description* | *Current value (if the bookmaker is enabled)* |
| =%<nop>BOOKMAKER_IN_OPEN_BOOK%= | Used in =%<nop>IF= statements to test if the current topic is included in the currently open book. Always false if no book is open. | %BOOKMAKER_IN_OPEN_BOOK% |
| =%<nop>BOOKMAKER_BOOK%= | Name of the open book | <nop>%BOOKMAKER_BOOK% |
| =%<nop>BOOKLIST%= | Get a formatted list of the pages in the currently open book (or another book if a parameter is given, e.g. =%<nop>BOOKLIST{"Otherweb.Bookname"}%=. | <nop>%BOOKLIST% |

Note that =BOOKLIST= will accept a book name with no web specification; in this case, the =BOOKMAKER_BOOKWEB=
preference will be referred to for the name of a web or, if it is not set, the =Sandbox= web will be used.

=BOOKLIST= also accepts =format= and =separator= parameters. These are expanded to create each entry in the list, and the separator used in the list. For example, to use =BOOKLIST= to pull in the entire contents of the topics in the book, you could use:
<verbatim>
%BOOKLIST{format="$percntINCLUDE{"$web.$topic"}$percnt" separator="$n()"}%
</verbatim>
As well as =$web= and =$topic=, the index depth of the topic can be obtained from =$level=. All standard [[FormatTokens][formatting tokens]] are also expanded.
